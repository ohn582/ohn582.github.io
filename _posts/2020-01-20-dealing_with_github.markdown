Github is used to up load your code no matter if its small or a large project and you can edit your code after uploading your project. Github also provides multiple types of language code such as C++, html, css, JS, etc. It's a great way to share with a team your work. However, their are flaws with git hub. It can only upload a small amount of falies to make it work, but if you want to upload your lager project, it gets really annoying, once you upload your project, it creates an error saying that their a fetch url error. The cause if this is becuse you github is corrupted, not your code file. The best way to avoid this is to recreate your rails backend and DO NOT delete your old backend file since you are using to recreate a new backend file.

Most of your work such as you project, challenges, etc that you create for class is very large and you always have to dependant on using your console. It can be a hassale because you can easily can create a mistake since you are creating a lot of commands.
